🎙️🔊 Welcome to Resonance! 🎧

We're excited to have you here and ready to experience the power of sound. The app allows you to stream a wide variety of music genres and audios at any decibel level, all in one place. With our intuitive interface and powerful search capabilities, loudmicing is easier than ever.

Please note that while most of the features are fully functional, numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are currently a work in progress. I/We apologize for any inconvenience and promise to get them up and running as soon as possible.

Resonance developers kindly ask that you do not abuse this app as it operates similarly to Ripcord and may result in you being blacklisted if you try to use it to get on Loudlist. We want to maintain a safe and enjoyable experience for all our users.

So, grab your Discord token and audio URL, turn up the volume, and enjoy Resonance! 🔥🎶

Additional: I am aware that once you use the music selfbot it doesnt let you leave. That is going to be fixed in V1.5
